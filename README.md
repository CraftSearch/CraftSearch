# CraftSearch
CraftSearch is the worldwide first innovative Minecraft search engine that finds you servers in-game since 2016. Connect with one click to the server YOU want.

## How to build
1. Download the source code using GitHub (download as a .zip, then extract it).
2. Create an empty java project on your favorite Java IDE (name is as you want and choose either Java 1.7 or 1.8). We will show you screenshots of Eclipse Oxygen.
3. Import the /src/ folder in it. To import it :  
3.1. Drag & drop the src folder on your project, and if promoted, select "copy folders and files". Try to NOT create links.

4. Select your Spigot build in the Build Path. To do so, right click the project, go to the Build Path menu and select "Add External Archives", and select your Spigot(x.xx.x).jar. If you don't have any spigot version on your computer, download one from Internet.
